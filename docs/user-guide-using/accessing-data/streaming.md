# Streaming Data

Streaming data allows you to access and analyze {{ instance.name }} data without downloading entire files. This is particularly useful for large datasets where downloading the complete files would be impractical.

## Streaming Methods

DANDI provides several methods for streaming data:

### 1. Python-based streaming methods

Using Python, you can set up data streaming using remfile, fsspec, or ros3. See the [PyNWB streaming tutorial](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/advanced_io/streaming.html) for details. Note that these streaming methods tend to work better on [DANDI Hub](../dandi-hub.md), where data access is faster.

### 2. DataLad FUSE Mount

[DataLad FUSE](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-fuse/) allows you to mount {{ instance.name }} datasets as if they were local files, with data being streamed on-demand when accessed.

```bash
# Install DataLad and DataLad FUSE
pip install datalad datalad-fuse

# Clone a Dandiset without downloading content
datalad clone https://github.com/dandisets/000123 dandiset-000123
cd dandiset-000123

# Mount the dataset
datalad fusefs -f .

# Now you can access files in the mountpoint directory
# Data will be streamed as needed
```
