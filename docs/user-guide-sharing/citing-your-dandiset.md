# Citing your own Dandiset

After publishing your Dandiset, it's important to properly cite it in your research publications. This page provides guidance on how to cite your own Dandiset in your publications.

## Why Cite Your Dandiset

Citing your Dandiset is important because it:

- Provides a direct link to the data used in your research
- Facilitates reproducibility by allowing others to access the exact data you used
- Helps track the impact of your data
- Establishes your data as a citable research output, which can be tracked for impact metrics
- Follows best practices for open science

## How to Cite Your Dandiset

When citing your Dandiset:

1. **Use the DOI**: Each published version of your Dandiset receives a unique DOI (Digital Object Identifier). This DOI can be found on the Dandiset's landing page on the DANDI Archive website.

2. **Use the "CITE AS" button**: The Dandiset's landing page provides an example formatted citation at the "CITE AS" button. This citation uses the DataCite citation style, which is a widely accepted standard for citing datasets.

3. **Adapt to journal requirements**: You may need to adapt the citation format to match the citation style required by the journal you are submitting to.

## Data Availability Statement

Many journals require a Data Availability Statement in the manuscript. This statement should include the DANDI Archive RRID and the DOI of your Dandiset.

Here is an example of a well-formatted Data Availability Statement:

> The data that support the findings of this study are openly available on the DANDI Archive (RRID:SCR_017571) at [DOI of Dandiset] (citation of Dandiset).

**Important**: A Data Availability Statement does not replace the need for a full citation in the manuscript's references section. Both elements serve different purposes and are typically required for comprehensive documentation of data sources.

## Citing Both Dandiset and Publication

If your Dandiset is associated with a publication:

- Cite both the Dandiset and the publication in your references
- In the Data Availability Statement, you can reference both the Dandiset and the publication
- Link the Dandiset and publication in the "Related Resources" section of your Dandiset metadata

This approach ensures that both your data and your analysis receive proper attribution.
