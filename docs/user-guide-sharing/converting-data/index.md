# Standardizing Data

Data contributed to DANDI must be standardized into one of the formats accepted by DANDI.

Most of the data on DANDI is in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB), a data standard designed for sharing data from neurophysiology experiments.
See [Converting data to NWB](./nwb/index.md) for guidance in how to convert your data to NWB and publish on DANDI.

DANDI also supports the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). For more information, see:
- [Getting Started with BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/getting_started/index.html)
- [BIDS converters](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/tools/converters.html) for conversion of raw data to a BIDS dataset
- [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io)
