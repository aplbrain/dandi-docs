# NeuroConv

[NeuroConv](https://neuroconv.readthedocs.io/) is a Python library that automates conversion to NWB from a variety of popular neurophysiology data formats.

## Overview

NeuroConv provides a standardized approach for converting neurophysiology data to the NWB format. It offers:

- A consistent API for converting data from different sources
- Automated metadata extraction from source files
- Validation of the resulting NWB files
- Support for a wide range of data formats

The [Conversion Gallery](https://neuroconv.readthedocs.io/en/main/conversion_examples_gallery/index.html) provides examples for converting data from various formats.

## When to Use NeuroConv

NeuroConv is ideal for:

- Converting data from supported formats to NWB
- Batch processing of multiple files
- Integration into automated workflows
- Users comfortable with Python programming

For users who prefer a graphical interface, [NWB GUIDE](./nwb-guide.md) might be a better option. For formats not supported by NeuroConv or for more complex conversion needs, direct use of [PyNWB and MatNWB](./pynwb-matnwb.md) might be necessary.
