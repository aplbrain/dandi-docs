# Create a {{ instance.name }} Account

A {{ instance.name }} account enhances your capabilities within the {{ instance.name }} Archive.
Without an account, users can freely search, view, and download available datasets.
With an account, users can create and edit Dandisets, and use the {{ instance.name }} Hub to analyze data.

{{ instance.name }} provides two servers:

- **Main server**: [{{ instance.uri }}/]({{ instance.uri }}/) - This is the primary platform for most users.
- **Sandbox server**: [{{ instance.sandbox_uri }}/]({{ instance.sandbox_uri }}/) - Ideal for training and testing purposes.

Accounts are independently managed on each server, allowing users to register on one or both, depending on their testing and deployment needs.

{{ instance.name }} is freely accessible to the neuroscience research community.
Membership is usually granted automatically to GitHub accounts with a `.edu` or similar academic email.
If your registration is denied:

- With an academic email not linked to your GitHub, please contact [help@{{ instance.domain }}](mailto:help@{{ instance.domain }}) for assistance using this email address.
- Without an academic email, account approval is still possible under specific circumstances. Appeal decisions at [help@{{ instance.domain }}](mailto:help@{{ instance.domain }}).
