# Creating a {{ instance.name }} Instance

The series of docs in this directory define how to create your own {{ instance.name }} ecosystem (i.e. a clone of the entire {{ instance.name }} ecosystem).
It is suggested that you briefly read through each of the documents in this guide before starting.

For an overview of the {{ instance.name }} system architecture and how its components fit together, please see [System Architecture](../system-architecture.md).
