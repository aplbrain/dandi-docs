# Creating a DANDI Instance

The series of docs in this directory define how to create your own DANDI ecosystem (i.e. a clone of the entire DANDI ecosystem).
It is suggested that you briefly read through each of the documents in this guide before starting.

For an overview of the DANDI system architecture and how its components fit together, please see [System Architecture](../system-architecture.md).
