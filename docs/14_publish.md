# Publishing Dandisets

1. Once you create a Dandiset, DANDI will automatically create a `draft` version
 of the Dandiset that can be changed as many times as needed by editing the 
 metadata or uploading new files.

1. Prior to publishing, edit the Dandiset metadata.  For example, update the 
following fields:
    1. People and funding contributors
    1. Protocol information
    1. Keywords
    1. Related resources such as publications and code repositories

1. When all the metadata and asset errors are fixed, the `Publish` button (on 
the right panel of the Dandiset landing page) will be enabled and turn green.

1. Note, Dandisets with Zarr assets currently cannot be published.  We are 
actively working on enabling this feature.

1. Publishing your Dandiset will create a unique version and the content of the 
specific published version of the Dandiset cannot be changed.  If you need to 
change the data or metadata in the future, you will need to create 
another version of your Dandiset. 

1. When you are ready to publish your Dandiset, click the `Publish` button.
